## Instruction

### First Day of a Cohort
The first day for the students is very structured with presentations, ice breakers and coding.  The instructors help prepare for this with the following tasks.

- Reviewing profiles of incoming students
- Setting up any documents that will be used (attendance, assessments, lesson plans, etc)
- Reviewing the detailed first day schedule and assigning staff members to presentations/activities
- Communication with staff members about who is assigned to facilitate presentations/activities(Meeting, Slack)
- Lesson planning for first week (topics and facilitators)

Here is the first day document that is used to plan presentations and who will be facilitating those.

[ First Day Presentations (Google Drive) ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SZhhS4ff-v_Yht9GDIYuMDmAzwBOy9Kf)



###  Daily Schedule
The general layout of the day looks like this:

Time         | Activity
------------ | --------
8:45 - 9:00  | Classroom Opens
9:00 - 9:15  | Class Check in
9:15 - 12:00 | Lecture/Challenges
12:00 - 1:00 | Lunch
1:00 - 4:00  | Lecture/Challenges
4:00 - 5:00  | Discussion/Wrap Up/Demos

Keep in mind that this schedule is flexible and could shift depending on the content of the day and the needs of the class.

For the most part, the days consist of either a morning and afternoon lesson with challenges in between, or with one lesson in the morning and challenges the rest of the day.

*Note*: The lunch hour is your lunch hour as well with exception to Tuesdays. This is when Learn Staff Meetings take place.

###  The Syllabus

Here is a link to the Course Syllabus: [ LEARNAcademy Syllabus ](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus)

This is the home of the curriculum and includes materials for just about all the lessons and challenges the course covers.

Notice that it is a repo within the LearnAcademy Github organization.

This version of the syllabus is where all cohort syllabi derive. For each cohort a Github organization is created and the current version of the Learn syllabus is forked to that organization.

Here is an example of a previous cohort syllabus: [ Bravo 2019 Syllabus ](https://github.com/learn-academy-2019-bravo/Syllabus)

When giving a lesson, you will typically work from the material on the cohort syllabus.

*Note*: On occasion a change may be required on the syllabus. For the workflow on pushing changes to the syllabus and to cohort syllabi follow this [ link ](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus/wiki) to the syllabus wiki.

###  Lesson Planning

Here is an example of a lesson plan doc: [ Bravo 2019 Lesson Plans](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SB5sFVPqlp5l22Slp9IlYhyBxndSYsw6ZAeMvuFvTYg/edit#gid=959192181)

Lesson planning often happens a week in advance and is usually tracked on a Google spreadsheet. A lesson plan doc is typically created in the LearnAcademy Google Drive for a cohort a few weeks before it starts.

### Classroom Facilitation

#### Check In

We start every morning with a class check in. Check in is where the class gathers in a circle with the instructors and each individual 'checks in' for the day. It's a stand in for the stand ups students will do during their capstone projects.

First a question is posed to the group. Some examples of past questions include:

- What are you most proud of?
- What is your favorite video game?
- If you could time travel, what time period would you visit?

Each person answers the question and tells the group a little bit about their status coming into the day (mood/fears/situation). When they are done, they complete their check in by saying "I'm checking in". To which the group replies "Welcome". This continues until everyone is checked in.

#### Plan for the Day

At the beginning of each day, a check in question and a plan for the day are written out on one of the large whiteboards mostly to set up an expectation for what the day's flow.

Additional useful information to put on the board are the scheduled speakers and any other non-coding activities that are to happen during the week.

#### Weekly Retros

Midway through the course, weekly retros become part of the class schedule. This gives the students and the instructing staff a feel for what worked and what didn't during the week.

In the past we've used a couple of formats.

**Liked | Learned | Loathed**

- Each student is given some sticky notes. 
- For a predetermined amount of time students write one note per sticky for things that they **liked**, **learned**, and **loathed**. Students post the stickies up on the whiteboard. 
- When time is up, the students go up to the board and arrange the stickies by topics. Then students and instructors discuss the topics listed. 

**3 Learned | 2 Questions | 1 AHA!**

- Each student is given some sticky notes. 
- For a predetermined amount of time students think of **3 things they learned**, **2 questions they have**, and **1 AHA! moment**. 
- Each student writes a note per sticky for each item in a category and posts it in their corresponding columns on a whiteboard. 
- A student then volunteers to organize the stickies. 
- Finally, instructors read through some of the stickies and answer some of the questions from the questions column.

## Instructor Tools

#### Github

Just about all the course materials live on Github. There are repos that exist for the syllabus, class assessments, and projects. Each organization will have their own copies of these materials. Most of the larger student projects and all assessments are administered through Github Classroom.

#### Github Classroom

Github Classroom essentially allows us to track student work throughout the course and its use increases student interaction with git and Github.

Here assignments are created for a cohort organization and links are generated that, when clicked by student, triggers the generation of a repo for that project within the cohort organization.

[Weekly individual assessments](#grading-assessments) are assigned each Friday via GitHub Classroom.

#### Youtube

LEARN uses Youtube to capture lessons using Live Events.

Here is a link to the steps to creating a Live Event: [Creating Youtube Live Events](./youtube-live-events.md)

#### Google Drive

Google drive contains many of the documents related to non-curriculum related tasks. It contains documents to help you track lesson plans, inventory, first day schedules, and a host of other things.

#### HubSpot

HubSpot is LEARN's CRM (Customer Relationship Management) used to track student communication, progress, and interactions from their initial contact with LEARN all the way through job placement. As an instructor, you are responsible for adding notes detailing the One-on-One meetings that take place twice a during a cohort, typically in Week 3 and Week 8. To access HubSpot you will need to:
- Follow [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXeTc41fmtYuk8gF72a8nMN5T1gRUQYUaAQ98RKHGifZSWVA/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1) to a google form
- Enter the student's email
- Select the appropriate Meeting (1 or 2)
- Include the date, the name of the person who conducted the One-on-One, and any pertinent details
- Submit! Woo!

## Operations

### Meetings

There are two meetings that instructors are regularly a part of. What follows is a breakdown of those meetings.

#### Staff Meetings

All Learn staff attend these weekly meetings which are typically held on Tuesdays during the lunch hour. It is on occasion moved to another day if for example a bulk of staff cannot attend.

But the meeting is essentially a check in with all the departments. It is organized such that each department (Marketing, Career Services, Instruction etc.) provides an update and answers any questions about what's happening in their realm of the organization.

For instructors, this is the time to give an update on the classroom, request any resources, or bring up any issues that have come about in the classroom. Since it is often challenging to keep track of all classroom items throughout the week and in between meetings, it is valuable to utilize the [ Classroom Admin Trello board ](https://trello.com/b/dQBMlYpI/classroom-admin) and keep it up to date for staff meetings.

#### Instructor Meetings

These meetings are also typically held on a weekly basis. This is when instructors usually set up the teaching schedule (document who is going to teach which lessons), review and determine any necessary curriculum changes, delegate tasks related to curriculum changes, and discuss the the progress being made by the class. Discussions can sometimes lead to adjustments being made to the curriculum or the strategies used for teaching in the classroom.

It's worth noting that many of the above items are often done ad hoc throughout the course.

### Communication Tools

#### Slack

Slack is the main channel of communication within Learn. You will use it to coordinate both with staff and students.

The dedicated instructor channel is here: [ Teachers Channel ](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/CFRADSRBN/)

Other useful channels include:
- [ Staff Channel ](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/G9Q5GU5UJ/)
- [ Everybody Channel ](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/C04B40L4U/)
- [ Events Channel](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/C15TQTQMB/)

If you are interested, ask to be invited to some of these channels:
- [ Learn Site Development Channel ](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/G0YG9UN01/)
- [ Marketing Channel ](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/G0LKQ1HMJ/)

You will eventually join other channels as well including various cohort channels and the channels created by students entering capstone projects.


#### Trello

Trello is used throughout Learn to track our tasks and objectives.

The classroom and curriculum tasks are tracked here: [ Classroom Admin Trello Board ](https://trello.com/b/dQBMlYpI/classroom-admin)

For a guide to the Classroom Admin Trello board, follow this link: [ Guide to Classroom Trello ](./classroom-admin-trello.md)

Be sure to ask to be added to the following boards if interested:

- [ Events ](https://trello.com/b/ofzfjXLM/events)
- [ Career Services & Internship ](https://trello.com/b/Xl22q6Ry/career-services-internship)
- [ Marketing ](https://trello.com/b/q2s0uEzR/marketing)
- [ Operations](https://trello.com/b/saxLJBxV/operations)

### Inventory

#### Classroom Inventory

Classroom inventory is checked on a weekly basis, ideally before staff meetings when any needs can be brought to the attention of admin staff.

Classroom inventory (dry erase markers, printer ink, etc) is tracked here: [Ordering Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YCa8ulGBugSBD9vNvBCwnvaFcrZMYBq-nZKkrC4txzI/edit#gid=555668496)

If it turns out there is any need for resources, a comment written with @chelseakaufman can be added to the [ Inventory ](https://trello.com/c/EKJAXwAa/6-inventory-mondays) card in Trello.

#### Station Inventory

Station inventory is checked on a daily basis just to ensure that we are aware if any of our machines or peripherals move.

Station inventory is tracked here: [ Station Inventory ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1361Y_1O6hv-iLjWUgy-mopdFWeo8bd7E980XWjaL1QU/edit#gid=0)

This document just tracks the count of working equipment in each room. If any equipment breaks or becomes defective it is tracked in repairs here: [ Repair Inventory ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EIPpqnUuRsLUr4PhzelK0eXf7FjBDU12Y18kf3kmKuI/edit#gid=0)

Any defective equipment can be written in a comment on the [ Repair ](https://trello.com/c/RQnIlOWZ/5-repair) card in Trello.

Typically, defective computer equipment is assessed by Rob before disposal. Larger equipment broken chairs/desks will be assessed by admin staff and usually handled by Union.

#### Machine Imaging

##### Classroom Machines

When there is an incoming class, we re-image all the machines in classroom that will serve as their lab. The process is documented here under  the first item 'Imaging Machines': [LEARN Classroom Setup Mac Mini](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZ1iNVaLKyDg6CTkNHZ0TdscdoYeQvczLaZKWibYfY0/edit#heading=h.efghimpqj7mi)

This is generally handled by the more senior Learn instructors.

##### LEARN Loaner Machines

LEARN has Mac laptops available for students to borrow during the month of their internship if needed. After each use the machine needs to be re-imaged. The process is documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gNE-rdnkEMpRpYscRg4jb5H13SpevpazLd5_q1cMKtA/edit).

## Day to Day Tasks

There are several tasks that instructing staff share. What tasks you ultimately take lead on will usually depend on your strengths and the role that suites you on the team.

Here is a broad breakdown of those tasks:

**Classroom Operations**

- Daily Schedule
- [Attendance](#attendance)
- Instruction
- [Grading Assessments](#grading-assessments)
- [Student One on ones](#hubSpot)
- Fireside Chats

**Admin/Facilitation**
- Classroom Inventory
- [Station Inventory](#station-inventory)
- Attendance Issues
- Tuesday [Yoga](#yoga) Setup
- PD Schedule Coordination
- [Station Imaging](#machine-imaging)

**Jumpstart**
- [Jumpstart Trello](https://trello.com/b/BYycV15b/jumpstart) for Prep and Planning
- Instructor/ TA / Admin Scheduling
- Monday Email to Participants
- Communication via Slack for All Involved
- Meal planning
- Food ordering and delivery
- Jump Drive Setup
- Curriculum Folders

### Attendance

Attendance is taken daily and tracked in the LEARN google drive with a form [like this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VOQx_bi_tPLPkTqkzCNya1TiwfCoMQg4sJGAllraY98/edit#gid=0). Students are expected to be in class everyday from 9-5. If a student misses the class check in the student is considered late. Habitual tardiness or absences put the student at risk to be disqualified for internship. The full absence policy can be found [here](./attendance-issues.md).

### Grading Assessments
Assessments are given every Friday afternoon for the first six weeks of class. The assessments are individual assignments that combine code challenges and short answer conceptual questions. Assessments are due before the start of class the following Monday. The students are responsible for submitting their assessments via pull request. Full details of the [assessment process](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus/blob/master/tools_and_resources/assessments.md) are in the syllabus. Once submitted, the instructors:
-  Review the code and short answers and give feedback with comments in GitHub
- If the assessment is complete and up to par, the instructor can approve the request
- If the code needs improvement, leave specific comments and `request changes` in GitHub
- Once the pull request is approved, the student will merge their code to master and their assessment is complete
- To track this process, a google form [like this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yuCX35WVoLucztOmAgs_8pDH_LeQvLlhY7RE80ljqhc/edit#gid=0) is kept in the LEARN drive
- Assessments serve as a tool to identify students who need may need additional help or one-on-one attention

### Yoga

LEARN offers a yoga class (as well as mats and supplies) to the students and faculty every Tuesday at 5:30pm. On Monday, the faculty in charge of organizing yoga can reach out to the usual participants via the Slack [Yoga Channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T04B40L2C/CLBAWENES). If two or more participants intend to join, confirm with our wonderful instructor, Renda. Hillary can provide her contact information. Yoga is practiced in the classroom with the furniture pushed to the side. 

## Capstone Projects Tasks

The role and tasks of the instructor during the Capstone Project weeks changes quite a bit. Here are some resources to help get you prepared for those weeks:

**In preparation for Capstone Projects, instructors:**
- Create groups
- Schedule the Agile/Scrum Presentation
- Present project requirements
- Present groups
- Facilitate the project planning process

The requirements of the capstone project are established in a Capstone Project Spec document presented before they are assigned groups.


### Requirements

A template of that doc is here:
[ Capstone Projects Specs Template ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TzvKHFWc4VZB0Qa97pgO0RX6jaAuOCvpq77fFtC9ji0/edit)


### Instructor Tasks

During the capstone weeks instructors:

- Participate in and help moderate morning stand-ups
- Conduct code reviews
- Provide additional lessons (where applicable)

The main capstone project days themselves are essentially lab days with few to no lessons. The first day has a bit more structure.

**First Day**

The order sometimes varies, but these are the checkpoints:

- Agile Talk
- Break out into groups
    - Decide on project
    - Determine MVP
    - Create wireframes
    - Create user stories
    - Create repo
    - All group members added to the project repo

***After* the First Day** of capstone projects there are a few checkpoints building up to the **Final Client Check In**:

- **Day two**: First Deploy
- **End of week one**: First Client Check In/Second Deploy
- **Mid week 2**: Mini Client Check in
- **End of week 2**: Final Client Check In

Ideally, the projects are fully deployed *prior* to the Final Client Check In.

**Code Reviews (Reviewing Pull Requests)**

Reviewing pull requests on the capstone projects becomes a one of the main tasks for instructors during this phase of the program. It is an opportunity for instructors to fill in some of the best practice gaps and work in the some real world conceptual and domain knowledge.

Comment up those PRs!

It is expected that you will bring your best practices with you along with your PR standards, some of which may be listed here. But you can start with these:

- Address formatting issues
- Recommend deleting broken/incomplete/commented out code
- Draw attention to opportunities to refactor (DRY up or otherwise clean up implementation)
- Recommend removing logs (`console.log()`/`puts`/`pp`)

**Client Check Ins**

Client check ins are an opportunity for instructors to figure out where the projects are, guide steps forward, and help teams narrow the scope of their projects.

The process sometimes varies but looks something like this:

- Examine completed features
- Examine and update user stories (on Trello) with feedback from first look
- Examine remaining stories
- Refine and/or prioritize remaining stories

**Issues During Capstone Projects**

Capstone projects typically present new challenges for students particularly in regards to project management and working on a bigger team. More often than not, when expectations are clearly set (project requirements/process) the projects run pretty smoothly even with the new development hurdles students face.

Still, conflict may arise but may be mitigated at more ideal times if warning signs are caught early on.

Though not always signs of trouble here are some of the **warning signs** that may indicate issues within a group:

- Silos (if it's causing a persistent bottleneck)
- Lack of pull requests from group/individuals
- No requests for code reviews
- Repeatedly getting in late/missing stand up
- Repeatedly leaving early
- Break down of communication
    - Committing over each others' work
    - No clear understanding of what teammates are working on

## Tech Talks

Students are required to present a Tech Talk. For the most part all the Tech Talks are presented on the same day during the last week of a cohort.

### Leading up to Tech Talks

During PD week, students are encouraged to start thinking about their talks. The week before Tech Talks, a sign up sheet is given to a cohort where students can self select their time and their subject. Depending on the size of the cohort, the talks are split into two rooms.

### Preparation

Students are encouraged to have slides to go with their presentations and to practice. Still, there are things that can be done in preparation for the talks that will make them run a bit smoother.

Tech Talk Room Checklist:

- Projector is working (bulb not dead)
- Sound is working (through Sonos or otherwise)
- HDMI cable

### Feedback

Both admin and instruction staff take part in providing tech talk feedback. 

Providing feedback is less about grading student performance than it is about getting students comfortable with giving a tech talk and providing tips on how to improve a talk.

As such we typically a modified 'Perfection Game' approach. In short, when providing feedback a staff member touches on:

- What was great about the talk
- What could be done to elevate the talk

The tips and advice on elevating a talk can and does often range from having more prominent contact info on slides to emphasizing a previous career in connection to the material.
