# Instructor Handbook

This document is intended to help get you up to speed and navigating the classroom with confidence. It is more guide than it is directive. As such, use it as a foundation to work from and add your personal flare to.

## Instruction

### First Day of a Cohort
The first day for the students is very structured with presentations, ice breakers and coding.  The instructors help prepare for this with the following tasks.

- Reviewing Profiles of Incoming students
- Setting up any documents that will be used (attendance, assessments, lesson plans, etc)
- Reviewing the detailed first day schedule and assigning staff members to presentations/activities
- Communication with staff members about who is assigned to facilitate presentations/activities(Meeting, Slack)
- Lesson planning for first week (topics and facilitators)

Here is the first day document that is used to plan presentations and who will be facilitating those.  


[ First Day Schedule ]()



###  Daily Schedule
The general layout of the day looks like this:

Time         | Activity
------------ | --------
8:45 - 9:00  | Classroom Opens
9:00 - 9:15  | Class Check in
9:15 - 12:00 | Lecture/Challenges
12:00 - 1:00 | Lunch
1:00 - 4:00  | Lecture/Challenges
4:00 - 5:00  | Discussion/Wrap Up/Demos

Keep in mind that this schedule is flexible and could shift depending on the content of the day and the needs of the class.

For the most part, the days consist of either a morning and afternoon lesson with challenges in between, or with one lesson in the morning and challenges the rest of the day.

*Note*: The lunch hour is your lunch hour as well with exception to Tuesdays. This is when Learn Staff Meetings take place.

###  The Syllabus

Here is a link to the Course Syllabus: [ LEARNAcademy Syllabus ](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus)

This is the home of the curriculum and includes materials for just about all the lessons and challenges the course covers.

Notice that it is a repo within the LearnAcademy Github organization.

This version of the syllabus is where all cohort syllabi derive. For each cohort a Github organization is created and the current version of the Learn syllabus is forked to that organization.

Here is an example of a previous cohort syllabus: [ Bravo 2019 Syllabus ](https://github.com/learn-academy-2019-bravo/Syllabus)

When giving a lesson, you will typically work from the material on the cohort syllabus.

*Note*: On occasion a change may be required on the syllabus. For the workflow on pushing changes to the syllabus and to cohort syllabi follow this [ link ](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus/wiki) to the syllabus wiki.

###  Lesson Planning

Here is an example of a lesson plan doc: [ Bravo 2019 Lesson Plans](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SB5sFVPqlp5l22Slp9IlYhyBxndSYsw6ZAeMvuFvTYg/edit#gid=959192181)

Lesson planning often happens a week in advance and is usually tracked on a Google spreadsheet. A lesson plan doc is typically created in the LearnAcademy Google Drive for a cohort a few weeks before it starts.

### Classroom Facilitation

#### Check In

We start every morning with a class check in. Check in is where the class gathers in a circle with the instructors and each individual 'checks in' for the day. It's a stand in for the stand ups students will do during their capstone projects.

First a question is posed to the group. Some examples of past questions include:

- What are you most proud of?
- What is your favorite video game?
- If you could time travel, what time period would you visit?

Each person answers the question and tells the group a little bit about their status coming into the day (mood/fears/situation). When they are done, they complete their check in by saying "I'm checking in". To which the group replies "Welcome". This continues until everyone is checked in.

#### Plan for the Day

At the beginning of each day, a check in question and a plan for the day are written out on one of the large whiteboards mostly to set up an expectation for what the day's flow.

Additional useful information to put on the board are the scheduled speakers and any other non-coding activities that are to happen during the week.


## Instructor Tools

#### Github

Just about all the course materials live on Github. There are repos that exist for the syllabus, class assessments, and projects. Each organization will have their own copies of these materials. Most of the larger student projects and all assessments are administered through Github Classroom.

#### Github Classroom

Github Classroom essentially allows us to track student work throughout the course and its use increases student interaction with git and Github.

Here assignments are created for a cohort organization and links are generated that, when clicked by student, triggers the generation of a repo for that project within the cohort organization.

#### Google Drive

Google drive contains many of the documents related to non-curriculum related tasks. It contains documents to help you track lesson plans, inventory, first day schedules, and a host of other things.

## Operations

### Meetings

There are two meetings that instructors are regularly a part of. What follows is a breakdown of those meetings.

#### Staff Meetings

All Learn staff attend these weekly meetings which are typically held on Tuesdays during the lunch hour. It is on occasion moved to another day if for example a bulk of staff cannot attend.

But the meeting is essentially a check in with all the departments. It is organized such that each department (Marketing, Career Services, Instruction etc.) provides an update and answers any questions about what's happening in their realm of the organization.

For instructors, this is the time to give an update on the classroom, request any resources, or bring up any issues that have come about in the classroom. Since it is often challenging to keep track of all classroom items throughout the week and in between meetings, it is valuable to utilize the [ Classroom Admin Trello board ](https://trello.com/b/dQBMlYpI/classroom-admin) and keep it up to date for staff meetings.

#### Instructor Meetings

These meetings are also typically held on a weekly basis. This is when instructors usually set up the teaching schedule (document who is going to teach which lessons), review and determine any necessary curriculum changes, delegate tasks related to curriculum changes, and discuss the the progress being made by the class. Discussions can sometimes lead to adjustments being made to the curriculum or the strategies used for teaching in the classroom.

It's worth noting that many of the above items are often done ad hoc throughout the course.

### Communication Tools

#### Slack

Slack is the main channel of communication within Learn. You will use it to coordinate both with staff and students.

The dedicated instructor channel is here: [ Teachers Channel ](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/CFRADSRBN/)

Other useful channels include:
- [ Staff Channel ](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/G9Q5GU5UJ/)
- [ Everybody Channel ](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/C04B40L4U/)
- [ Events Channel](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/C15TQTQMB/)

If you are interested, ask to be invited to some of these channels:
- [ Learn Site Development Channel ](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/G0YG9UN01/)
- [ Marketing Channel ](https://sdlearn.slack.com/messages/G0LKQ1HMJ/)

You will eventually join other channels as well including various cohort channels and the channels created by students entering capstone projects.


#### Trello

Trello is used throughout Learn to track our tasks and objectives.

The classroom and curriculum tasks are tracked here: [ Classroom Admin Trello Board ](https://trello.com/b/dQBMlYpI/classroom-admin)

Be sure to ask to be added to the following boards if interested:

- [ Events ](https://trello.com/b/ofzfjXLM/events)
- [ Career Services & Internship ](https://trello.com/b/Xl22q6Ry/career-services-internship)
- [ Marketing ](https://trello.com/b/q2s0uEzR/marketing)
- [ Operations](https://trello.com/b/saxLJBxV/operations)

### Inventory

#### Classroom Inventory

Classroom inventory is checked on a weekly basis, ideally before staff meetings when any needs can be brought to the attention of admin staff.

Classroom inventory (dry erase markers, printer ink, etc) is tracked here: [Ordering Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YCa8ulGBugSBD9vNvBCwnvaFcrZMYBq-nZKkrC4txzI/edit#gid=555668496)

If it turns out there is any need for resources, a comment written with @chelseakaufman can be added to the [ Inventory ](https://trello.com/c/EKJAXwAa/6-inventory-mondays) card in Trello.

#### Station Inventory

Station inventory is checked on a daily basis just to ensure that we are aware if any of our machines or peripherals move.

Station inventory is tracked here: [ Station Inventory ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1361Y_1O6hv-iLjWUgy-mopdFWeo8bd7E980XWjaL1QU/edit#gid=0)

This document just tracks the count of working equipment in each room. If any equipment breaks or becomes defective it is tracked in repairs here: [ Repair Inventory ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EIPpqnUuRsLUr4PhzelK0eXf7FjBDU12Y18kf3kmKuI/edit#gid=0)

Any defective equipment can be written in a comment on the [ Repair ](https://trello.com/c/RQnIlOWZ/5-repair) card in Trello.

Typically, defective computer equipment is assessed by Rob before disposal. Larger equipment broken chairs/desks will be assessed by admin staff and usually handled by Union.

#### Machine Imaging

When there is an incoming class, we re-image all the machines in classroom that will serve as their lab. The process is documented here under  the first item 'Imaging Machines': [LEARN Classroom Setup Mac Mini](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZ1iNVaLKyDg6CTkNHZ0TdscdoYeQvczLaZKWibYfY0/edit#heading=h.efghimpqj7mi)

This is generally handled by the more senior Learn instructors.
