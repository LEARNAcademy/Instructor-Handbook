## Instruction

### First Day of a Cohort
The first day for the students is very structured with presentations, ice breakers and coding.  The instructors help prepare for this with the following tasks.

- Reviewing profiles of incoming students
- Setting up any documents that will be used (attendance, assessments, lesson plans, etc)
- Reviewing the detailed first day schedule and assigning staff members to presentations/activities
- Communication with staff members about who is assigned to facilitate presentations/activities(Meeting, Slack)
- Lesson planning for first week (topics and facilitators)

Here is the first day document that is used to plan presentations and who will be facilitating those.

[ First Day Presentations (Google Drive) ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SZhhS4ff-v_Yht9GDIYuMDmAzwBOy9Kf)



### Daily Schedule
The general layout of the day looks like this:

Time         | Activity
------------ | --------
8:45 - 9:00  | Classroom Opens
9:00 - 9:15  | Class Check In
9:15 - 12:00 | Lecture/Challenges
12:00 - 1:00 | Lunch
1:00 - 4:00  | Lecture/Challenges
4:00 - 4:45  | Wrap Up/Demos
4:45 - 5:00  | Class Check Out

Keep in mind that this schedule is flexible and could shift depending on the content of the day and the needs of the class.

For the most part, the days consist of either a morning and afternoon lesson with challenges in between, or with one lesson in the morning and challenges the rest of the day.

*Note*: The lunch hour is your lunch hour as well with exception to Wednesdays. This is when Learn Staff Meetings take place.

**Note for Remote:** A virtual classroom requires additional planning and managing throughout the day. A detailed breakdown of Instructor responsibilities and flow for a virtual classroom can be found [here](./virtual-classroom.md).


### The Syllabus

Here is a link to the Course Syllabus: [ LEARNAcademy Syllabus ](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus)

This is the home of the curriculum and includes materials for just about all the lessons and challenges the course covers.

Notice that it is a repo within the LearnAcademy GitHub organization.

This version of the syllabus is where all cohort syllabi derive. For each cohort a Github organization is created and the current version of the Learn syllabus is forked to that organization.

Here is an example of a previous cohort syllabus: [ Bravo 2020 Syllabus ](https://github.com/learn-academy-2020-bravo/Syllabus)

When giving a lesson, you will typically work from the material on the cohort syllabus.

**Note**: The syllabus is a living document. For the workflow on pushing changes to the syllabus and to cohort syllabi follow this [ link ](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus/wiki) to the syllabus wiki. Also, please follow style guidelines outlined [here](#TBA).

### Lesson Planning

Here is an example of a lesson plan doc: [ Bravo 2020 Lesson Plans](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iCuFcBFi3l4SkKj4hdrlp8_jJF6f7445rL5oaoOcFUI/edit#gid=290937798)

Lesson planning happens once a week on Fridays in the Instructor meeting. This is tracked on a Google spreadsheet. A lesson plan doc is typically created in the Learn Academy Google Drive for a cohort a few weeks before it starts.

## Classroom Facilitation

### Check In

We start every morning with a class check in. Check in is where the class gathers in a circle with the instructors and each individual 'checks in' for the day. It's a stand in for the stand ups students will do during their capstone projects.

First a question is posed to the group. Some examples of past questions include:

- What are you most proud of?
- What is your favorite video game?
- If you could time travel, what time period would you visit?

Each person answers the question and tells the group a little bit about their status coming into the day (mood/fears/situation). When they are done, they complete their check in by saying "I'm checking in". To which the group replies "Welcome". This continues until everyone is checked in.

[List of questions in Google Drive can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h4VtVJIL5GlhZrsxX6dVQmEM2SL638r87SjqoShqYoU/edit?usp=sharing)

Within this document, please indicate which questions have been used (and for which cohort) to prevent repeating a question.

**Note for Remote:** In a [virtual classroom](./virtual-classroom.md), we require everyone turn their camera on during class check in. The response from the students can be a wave rather than an audible "welcome." The instructors will post the check in question and a list of the students names in random order each morning to both the class Slack channel and the Zoom chat.


### Plan for the Day

At the beginning of each day, a check in question and a plan for the day are written out on one of the large whiteboards mostly to set up an expectation for what the day's flow.

Additional useful information to put on the board are the scheduled speakers and any other non-coding activities.

**Note for Remote:** A daily schedule with all lectures, talks, Zoom links, and non-coding activities will be posted in Slack each evening for the following day.

### Weekly Retros

Weekly retros give the students and staff an opportunity to reflect on the week. 
Retrospectives usually run 15-30 minutes long and should not take the place of checkout when possible, 

In the past we've used a couple of formats.

**Liked | Learned | Longed for**

- Each student is given some sticky notes.
- For a predetermined amount of time students write one note per sticky for things that they **liked**, **learned**, and **longed for**.
- Students post the stickies up on the whiteboard.
- When time is up, the students go up to the board and arrange the stickies by topic.
- Students and instructors discuss the topics listed.

**3 Learned | 2 Questions | 1 AHA!**

- Each student is given some sticky notes.
- For a predetermined amount of time students think of **3 things they learned**, **2 questions they have**, and **1 AHA! moment**.
- Each student writes a note per sticky for each item in a category and posts it in their corresponding columns on a whiteboard.
- A student then volunteers to organize the stickies.
- Finally, instructors read through some of the stickies and answer some of the questions from the questions column.

**Wins and Losses**

- Win: Something that went well this week or felt successful this week
- Loss: Something that is still confusing or was difficult this week
- Each person has the opportunity to reflect and share with the team what was a win and a loss for the week

**Paired Questions**
(Useful for reviewing the Weekly Goals) 

- What feels solid:
- What feels shaky:

- What helps you be successful?
- If you could change one thing, what would it be?

- What are some big takeaways from this week?
- What was hard this week?


These formats are helpful for initiating conversation with and amongst the Students. 
  
Inside each classes LEARNers Drive you can find a document that will track the Weekly Check-in question and Weekly Retrospective. 
These documents should be updated each time Weekly goals are set and each time a Weekly retrospective takes place. This document is available to the students so that they can review their goals and takeaways from the week at any time.

### One-on-Ones
One-on-ones are an opportunity for the instructors to meet with the students individually to check-in. One-on-ones with the instruction team typically take place the week before the cohort begins, and during weeks 3, 9, and 12.

Notes from each one-on-one are documented in [HubSpot](./student-progress-hubspot.md).

The students will also have a one-on-one during week 7 with the career services manager regarding professional development.

It is also important to emphasize that the one-on-one is time allocated for doing what they need. Sometimes, it might be that they need to talk about group dynamics, anxieties, etc. Other times, it might mean that they need to pair-program on a problem so that they can more thoroughly understand a concept.

The structure of these meetings are typically freeform. It is left to the discretion of the instructor and student to discuss what is most helpful for the student. As a general guide, it is helpful to discuss the following:

**Week 0:**
- Motivations and decision process to join the full time course
- If they have a vision about what happens after the course
- What background do they have in programming? At college or professionally
- How have they found the online tutorials?
- Do they know what kind of learner they are?
- What technical equipment do they have at home?
- Remind them of what they should be doing to prepare for the first day of class
- Logistics for what a regular day looks like and what will be covered in the 12 weeks in class
- Expectations in terms of pair programming, collaboration and involvement in community
- Appearance, Etiquette and Professional Conduct
- This meeting is also an opportunity for students to ask questions about any and all aspects of the course.

Additional questions:
- What do you do when you get stuck?
- How do you find solutions to the problem you are currently facing?
- How long do you usually try to find a solution yourself before asking for help?
- How do you normally take notes?
- How comfortable do you feel asking questions in the middle of a lecture?
- How do you plan to manage a work-life balance?
- How do you track deadlines?
- How much out-of-classroom time do you plan to spend reviewing what you learned that day?
- How do you learn? Do you need to process information or do you absorb quickly?
- What do you think the difference is between a bootcamp and a regular class? (Goes into expectations of the program, not needing to memorize everything, ok to google, etc.)
- What kind of student are you?

**Week 3:**
- How the student is settling in at LEARN
- The student's career goals after LEARN
- How the student is responding to pair/mob programming

**Week 9:**
- How the student is responding to larger projects
- The student's ideas or concerns regarding capstone projects
- Discuss the student's internship interview concerns and provide tips and feedback

**Week 12:**
- Provide feedback on the student's tech talks
- Discuss the outcome of the student's capstone project
- Discuss the student's goals for internship

## Provisioning Machines

The provision repo is [here](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/provision).

### Classroom Machines

When there is an incoming class, we re-image all the machines in classroom that will serve as their lab. The process is documented here under the first item 'Imaging Machines': [LEARN Classroom Setup Mac Mini](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZ1iNVaLKyDg6CTkNHZ0TdscdoYeQvczLaZKWibYfY0/edit#heading=h.efghimpqj7mi)

This is generally handled by the more senior LEARN instructors.

### LEARN Loaner Machines

LEARN has Mac laptops available for students to borrow during the month of their internship if needed. After each use the machine needs to be re-imaged. The process is documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gNE-rdnkEMpRpYscRg4jb5H13SpevpazLd5_q1cMKtA/edit).



## Day to Day Tasks

There are several tasks that instructing staff share. What tasks you ultimately take lead on will usually depend on your strengths and the role that suites you on the team.

Here is a broad breakdown of those tasks:

**Classroom Operations**

- Daily Schedule
- [Attendance](#attendance)
- Instruction
- [Assessments](#assessments)
- [Student One on ones](#one-on-ones)
- Fireside Chats

**Admin/Facilitation**
- Classroom Inventory
- [Station Inventory](#station-inventory)
- [Attendance Issues](./attendance-issues.md)
- Tuesday [Yoga](#yoga) Setup
- PD Schedule Coordination
- [Station Imaging](#machine-imaging)

### Attendance

Attendance is taken daily and tracked in the LEARN Google drive with a form [like this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VOQx_bi_tPLPkTqkzCNya1TiwfCoMQg4sJGAllraY98/edit#gid=0). Students are expected to be in class everyday from 9-5. If a student misses the class check in the student is considered late. Habitual tardiness or absences put the student at risk to be disqualified for internship. The full absence policy can be found [here](./attendance-issues.md).

### Assessments
Assessments are given every Friday afternoon for the first six weeks of class. The assessments are individual assignments that combine code challenges and short answer conceptual questions. Assessments are due before the start of class the following Monday. The students are responsible for submitting their assessments via pull request. For full details of the [git workflow assessment process](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus/blob/master/tools_and_resources/assessments.md) are in the syllabus. 

[Here is a quick reference to assessment repos](./instructor-tools.md#github-classroom-assignments)

Once submitted, the instructors:
- Review the code and short answers and give feedback with comments in GitHub
- If the assessment is complete and up to par (see Grading Scale below), the instructor approves the pull request.
- Once the pull request is approved, the student will merge their code
- To track student process, a Google Sheet is used to stored notes about the assessment and feedback provided to the student. This document lives in the Admin Google Drive: `LEARN Academy > Classroom > \*Cohort Records and Documentation > Select the year the cohort is in > Select the cohort`. At the end of each cohort, these assessment and feedback info is transferred to HubSpot. (We track in the Google Sheet first, then transfer to HubSpot because it's quicker and easier to use week-to-week.)
- Assessments serve as a tool to identify students who need may need additional help or one-on-one attention. Reviewers should surface concerns to instruction staff if there are clear signs of thoughtless copy & pasting.

#### Reviewing Assessments

The goal of assessments is to allow the student to self-evaluate. While we have primarily not graded assessments, we're moving towards providing a marker of progress/proficiency on assessments as documented in the [Course Catalogue](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xU9dPvHPIcHHuZakHInZS4XVQbUBmdH--UtNdOhnf38/edit?usp=sharing).

The grading scale as of 3/25/2021 is as follows:
- **Proficient**: The student can put concepts together to form a whole, creating a new meaning or structure and make judgements about the value of the concepts or materials. 
- **Competent**: The student can apply the concepts in particular situations and/or separate concepts into component parts analyzing their organizational structure.
- **Advanced Beginner**: The student can recite memorized information about the concepts and/or demonstrate a basic understanding of the concepts by explaining them in his or her own words.
- **Incomplete**: An attempt has not been made on one or more questions in the assessment

#### Assessment Review Checklist

Things to account for when considering completeness of an assessment:
- Did the student attempt all questions/tests (even with only pseudocode)? 
- Were tests for each problem run? (evidenced by package.json file for jest testing)
- Did the student create a proper pull request to submit assessment?

Note: An attempt at a solution can be defined as: 
- a complete implementation of a solution
- a complete solution in pseudocode without code implementation
- a code implementation that does not run properly and notes outlining what the student attempted and where they got stuck
- an incomplete code implementation that includes pseudocode outlining their flow of logic
- interview answers in both the "your answer" and "researched answer" sections
- an attempt to provide definitions for all of the "looking ahead" terms

#### Feedback

It is important to communicate to the students the intention and goal of the assessments and grading scale. This will often need to be reestablished throughout the course. 

Feedback should be provided when:
- an answer is incomplete or does not run
- a student asks a question in their comments or explains where they got stuck
- the solution runs but could be more efficient (like nested for loops or if statements)
- a solution is done very well (leave celebratory feedback!)
- it's clear the student came to the solution easily and could use a challenge
- whenever the reviewer finds it necessary to provide additional guidance or information to the student

### Yoga

LEARN offers a yoga class (as well as mats and supplies) to the students and faculty every Tuesday at 5:30pm. On Monday, the faculty in charge of organizing yoga can reach out to the usual participants via the Slack [Yoga Channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T04B40L2C/CLBAWENES). If two or more participants intend to join, confirm with our wonderful instructor, Renda. Hillary or Sarah can provide her contact information. Yoga is practiced in the classroom with the furniture pushed to the side.

**Note for Remote:** Yoga will take place via Zoom. The link is provided by the yoga instructor and sent to the Yoga Slack channel.

## Capstone Projects Tasks

The role and tasks of the instructor during the Capstone Project weeks changes quite a bit. Here are some resources to help get you prepared for those weeks:

**In preparation for Capstone Projects, instructors:**
- Create groups
- Schedule the Agile/Scrum Presentation
- Present project requirements
- Present groups
- Facilitate the project planning process

The requirements of the capstone project are established in a Capstone Project Spec document presented before they are assigned groups.


### Requirements

A template of that doc is here:
[ Capstone Projects Specs Template ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TzvKHFWc4VZB0Qa97pgO0RX6jaAuOCvpq77fFtC9ji0/edit)


### Instructor Tasks

During the capstone weeks instructors:

- Participate in and help moderate morning stand-ups
- Conduct code reviews
- Provide additional lessons (where applicable)

The main capstone project days themselves are essentially lab days with few to no lessons. The first day has a bit more structure.

**First Day**

The order sometimes varies, but these are the checkpoints:

- Agile Talk
- Break out into groups
    - Decide on project
    - Determine MVP
    - Create wireframes
    - Create user stories
    - Create repo
    - All group members added to the project repo

**After the First Day** of capstone projects there are a few checkpoints building up to the **Final Client Check In**:

- **End of week one**: First Client Check In/ Deploy
- **Mid week 2**: Mini Client Check in
- **End of week 2**: Final Client Check In

Ideally, the projects are fully deployed *prior* to the Final Client Check In.

**Code Reviews (Reviewing Pull Requests)**

Reviewing pull requests on the capstone projects becomes one of the main tasks for instructors during this phase of the program. It is an opportunity for instructors to fill in some of the best practice gaps and work in the some real world conceptual and domain knowledge.

Comment up those PRs! 

It is expected that you will bring your best practices with you along with your PR standards, some of which may be listed here. But you can start with these:

- Address formatting issues
- Recommend deleting broken/incomplete/commented out code
- Draw attention to opportunities to refactor (DRY up or otherwise clean up implementation)
- Recommend removing logs (`console.log()`/`puts`/`pp`)
- Remind them about writing tests for their implementation

**Client Check Ins**

Client check ins are an opportunity for instructors to figure out where the projects are, guide steps forward, and help teams narrow the scope of their projects.

The process sometimes varies but looks something like this:

- Examine completed features
- Examine and update user stories (on Trello) with feedback from first look
- Examine remaining stories
- Refine and/or prioritize remaining stories

**Issues During Capstone Projects**

Capstone projects typically present new challenges for students particularly in regards to project management and working on a bigger team. More often than not, when expectations are clearly set (project requirements/process) the projects run pretty smoothly even with the new development hurdles students face.

Still, conflict may arise but may be mitigated at more ideal times if warning signs are caught early on.

Though not always signs of trouble here are some of the **warning signs** that may indicate issues within a group:

- Silos (if it's causing a persistent bottleneck)
- Lack of pull requests from group/individuals
- No requests for code reviews
- Repeatedly getting in late/missing stand up
- Repeatedly leaving early
- Break down of communication
    - Committing over each others' work
    - No clear understanding of what teammates are working on

## Tech Talks

Students are required to present a Tech Talk. For the most part all the Tech Talks are presented on the same day during the last week of a cohort.

### Leading up to Tech Talks

During PD week, students are encouraged to start thinking about their talks. The week before Tech Talks, a sign up sheet is given to a cohort where students can self select their time and their subject. Depending on the size of the cohort, the talks are split into two rooms.

### Preparation

Students are encouraged to have slides to go with their presentations and to practice. Still, there are things that can be done in preparation for the talks that will make them run a bit smoother.

Tech Talk Room Checklist:

- Projector is working (bulb not dead)
- Sound is working (through Sonos or otherwise)
- HDMI cable

**Note for Remote:**
- Everything will take longer than you expect. It is worth scheduling extra time.
- Remind students to practice sharing their presentations on Zoom ahead of time. Speaker notes are often harder to access on a screen share.


### Feedback

Both admin and instruction staff take part in providing tech talk feedback.

Providing feedback is less about grading student performance than it is about getting students comfortable with giving a tech talk and providing tips on how to improve a talk.

Tech talk feedback is aggregated and delivered to the student during a [one-on-one](#one-on-one) with an instructor.

## Jumpstart & Mini-Workshops

### Jumpstart

The goal of Jumpstart is to familiarize potential students with the day-to-day experience they would have within a cohort.
- Visit [Jumpstart Trello](https://trello.com/b/BYycV15b/jumpstart) for prep and planning tasks, TA handbook, information email templates that needs to be sent to attendees, and links to Google Drive for course materials

### Mini-Workshops

The goal of mini-workshops is to generate interest and help people with no coding experience build foundational understanding so that when they eventually attend Jumpstart, it isn't as intimidating and overwhelming. While the mini-workshop is a series, the approach for each workshop is that attendees have no coding experience and are not required to have attended any other mini-workshop.

Currently there are four mini-workshops:
1. WTF is Coding?
2. [Building your first website](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/build-your-own-website)
3. [Understanding Dev Tools](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/workshop-dev-tools)
