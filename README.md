# Instructor Handbook

This document is intended to help get you up to speed and navigating the classroom with confidence. It is more guide than it is directive. As such, use it as a foundation from which you can add your personal flare.

## Instruction

### First Day of a Cohort
The first day for the students is very structured with presentations, ice breakers and coding.  The instructors help prepare for this with the following tasks.

- Reviewing profiles of incoming students
- Setting up any documents that will be used (attendance, assessments, lesson plans, etc)
- Reviewing the detailed first day schedule and assigning staff members to presentations/activities
- Communication with staff members about who is assigned to facilitate presentations/activities(Meeting, Slack)
- Lesson planning for first week (topics and facilitators)

Here is the first day document that is used to plan presentations and who will be facilitating those.

[ First Day Presentations (Google Drive) ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SZhhS4ff-v_Yht9GDIYuMDmAzwBOy9Kf)



### Daily Schedule
The general layout of the day looks like this:

Time         | Activity
------------ | --------
8:45 - 9:00  | Classroom Opens
9:00 - 9:15  | Class Check In
9:15 - 12:00 | Lecture/Challenges
12:00 - 1:00 | Lunch
1:00 - 4:00  | Lecture/Challenges
4:00 - 4:45  | Wrap Up/Demos
4:45 - 5:00  | Class Check Out

Keep in mind that this schedule is flexible and could shift depending on the content of the day and the needs of the class.

For the most part, the days consist of either a morning and afternoon lesson with challenges in between, or with one lesson in the morning and challenges the rest of the day.

*Note*: The lunch hour is your lunch hour as well with exception to Wednesdays. This is when Learn Staff Meetings take place.

**Note for Remote:** A virtual classroom requires additional planning and managing throughout the day. A detailed breakdown of Instructor responsibilities and flow for a virtual classroom can be found [here](./virtual-classroom.md).


### The Syllabus

Here is a link to the Course Syllabus: [ LEARNAcademy Syllabus ](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus)

This is the home of the curriculum and includes materials for just about all the lessons and challenges the course covers.

Notice that it is a repo within the LearnAcademy GitHub organization.

This version of the syllabus is where all cohort syllabi derive. For each cohort a Github organization is created and the current version of the Learn syllabus is forked to that organization.

Here is an example of a previous cohort syllabus: [ Bravo 2020 Syllabus ](https://github.com/learn-academy-2020-bravo/Syllabus)

When giving a lesson, you will typically work from the material on the cohort syllabus.

**Note**: The syllabus is a living document. For the workflow on pushing changes to the syllabus and to cohort syllabi follow this [ link ](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus/wiki) to the syllabus wiki.

### Lesson Planning

Here is an example of a lesson plan doc: [ Bravo 2020 Lesson Plans](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iCuFcBFi3l4SkKj4hdrlp8_jJF6f7445rL5oaoOcFUI/edit#gid=290937798)

Lesson planning happens once a week on Fridays in the Instructor meeting. This is tracked on a Google spreadsheet. A lesson plan doc is typically created in the Learn Academy Google Drive for a cohort a few weeks before it starts.

## Classroom Facilitation

### Check In

We start every morning with a class check in. Check in is where the class gathers in a circle with the instructors and each individual 'checks in' for the day. It's a stand in for the stand ups students will do during their capstone projects.

First a question is posed to the group. Some examples of past questions include:

- What are you most proud of?
- What is your favorite video game?
- If you could time travel, what time period would you visit?

Each person answers the question and tells the group a little bit about their status coming into the day (mood/fears/situation). When they are done, they complete their check in by saying "I'm checking in". To which the group replies "Welcome". This continues until everyone is checked in.

**Note for Remote:** In a virtual classroom, we require everyone turn their camera on during class check in. The response from the students can be a wave rather than an audible "welcome." The instructors will post the check in question and a list of the students names in random order each morning to both the class Slack channel and the Zoom chat.


### Plan for the Day

At the beginning of each day, a check in question and a plan for the day are written out on one of the large whiteboards mostly to set up an expectation for what the day's flow.

Additional useful information to put on the board are the scheduled speakers and any other non-coding activities.

**Note for Remote:** A daily schedule with all lectures, talks, Zoom links, and non-coding activities will be posted in Slack each evening for the following day.

### Weekly Retros

Weekly retros give the students and staff an opportunity to reflect on the week.

In the past we've used a couple of formats.

**Liked | Learned | Longed for**

- Each student is given some sticky notes.
- For a predetermined amount of time students write one note per sticky for things that they **liked**, **learned**, and **longed for**.
- Students post the stickies up on the whiteboard.
- When time is up, the students go up to the board and arrange the stickies by topic.
- Students and instructors discuss the topics listed.

**3 Learned | 2 Questions | 1 AHA!**

- Each student is given some sticky notes.
- For a predetermined amount of time students think of **3 things they learned**, **2 questions they have**, and **1 AHA! moment**.
- Each student writes a note per sticky for each item in a category and posts it in their corresponding columns on a whiteboard.
- A student then volunteers to organize the stickies.
- Finally, instructors read through some of the stickies and answer some of the questions from the questions column.

**Wins and Losses**

- Win: Something that went well this week or felt successful this week
- Loss: Something that is still confusing or was difficult this week
- Each person has the opportunity to reflect and share with the team what was a win and a loss for the week

### One on Ones
One on ones are an opportunity for the instructors to meet with the students individually to check in. One on ones with the instruction team typically take place during weeks 3, 9, and 12.

The students will also have a one on one during week 7 with the career services manager regarding professional development.

The structure of these meetings are typically freeform. It is left to the discretion of the instructor and student to discuss what is most helpful for the student. As a general guide, it is helpful to discuss the following:

**Week 3:**
- How the student is settling in at LEARN
- The student's career goals after LEARN
- How the student is responding to pair/mob programming

**Week 9:**
- How the student is responding to larger projects
- The student's ideas or concerns regarding capstone projects
- Discuss the student's internship interview concerns and provide tips and feedback

**Week 12:**
- Provide feedback on the student's tech talks
- Discuss the outcome of the student's capstone project
- Discuss the student's goals for internship

Notes from each one on one are documented in [ HubSpot ](#hubspot).

To document the notes use [ this Google form ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YYbuipTsswmkb9FMjGEDXD2YoLiKZ_revxeUZ_B5NCU/edit)) or enter the notes directly into HubSpot:
- Search for the appropriate student in the search bar
- On the left hand column, scroll down to `view all properties`
- In the `All properties` list, scroll to the bottom and find the `1 on 1 Questions`
- Select the appropriate Check in Notes (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Include the date, the name of the person who conducted the one on one, and the pertinent details of your chat
- Save!

## Provisioning Machines

The provision repo is [here](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/provision).

### Classroom Machines

When there is an incoming class, we re-image all the machines in classroom that will serve as their lab. The process is documented here under the first item 'Imaging Machines': [LEARN Classroom Setup Mac Mini](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZ1iNVaLKyDg6CTkNHZ0TdscdoYeQvczLaZKWibYfY0/edit#heading=h.efghimpqj7mi)

This is generally handled by the more senior LEARN instructors.

### LEARN Loaner Machines

LEARN has Mac laptops available for students to borrow during the month of their internship if needed. After each use the machine needs to be re-imaged. The process is documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gNE-rdnkEMpRpYscRg4jb5H13SpevpazLd5_q1cMKtA/edit).



## Day to Day Tasks

There are several tasks that instructing staff share. What tasks you ultimately take lead on will usually depend on your strengths and the role that suites you on the team.

Here is a broad breakdown of those tasks:

**Classroom Operations**

- Daily Schedule
- [Attendance](#attendance)
- Instruction
- [Grading Assessments](#grading-assessments)
- [Student One on ones](#one-on-ones)
- Fireside Chats

**Admin/Facilitation**
- Classroom Inventory
- [Station Inventory](#station-inventory)
- Attendance Issues
- Tuesday [Yoga](#yoga) Setup
- PD Schedule Coordination
- [Station Imaging](#machine-imaging)

**Jumpstart**
- [Jumpstart Trello](https://trello.com/b/BYycV15b/jumpstart) for Prep and Planning
- Instructor/ TA / Admin Scheduling
- Monday Email to Participants
- Communication via Slack for All Involved
- Meal planning
- Food ordering and delivery
- Jump Drive Setup
- Curriculum Folders

### Attendance

Attendance is taken daily and tracked in the LEARN Google drive with a form [like this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VOQx_bi_tPLPkTqkzCNya1TiwfCoMQg4sJGAllraY98/edit#gid=0). Students are expected to be in class everyday from 9-5. If a student misses the class check in the student is considered late. Habitual tardiness or absences put the student at risk to be disqualified for internship. The full absence policy can be found [here](./attendance-issues.md).

### Grading Assessments
Assessments are given every Friday afternoon for the first six weeks of class. The assessments are individual assignments that combine code challenges and short answer conceptual questions. Assessments are due before the start of class the following Monday. The students are responsible for submitting their assessments via pull request. Full details of the [assessment process](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus/blob/master/tools_and_resources/assessments.md) are in the syllabus. Once submitted, the instructors:
-  Review the code and short answers and give feedback with comments in GitHub
- If the assessment is complete and up to par, the instructor can approve the request
- Once the pull request is approved, the student will merge their code to master and their assessment is complete
- To track this process, a google form [like this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15a68xRUube8kWDl3YE_0ziXHfB2Rzbo3YDRTRWLx3n0/edit#gid=0) is kept in the LEARN Google drive
- Assessments serve as a tool to identify students who need may need additional help or one-on-one attention

### Yoga

LEARN offers a yoga class (as well as mats and supplies) to the students and faculty every Tuesday at 5:30pm. On Monday, the faculty in charge of organizing yoga can reach out to the usual participants via the Slack [Yoga Channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T04B40L2C/CLBAWENES). If two or more participants intend to join, confirm with our wonderful instructor, Renda. Hillary can provide her contact information. Yoga is practiced in the classroom with the furniture pushed to the side.

**Note for Remote:** Yoga will take place via Zoom. The link is provided by the yoga instructor and sent to the Yoga Slack channel.

## Capstone Projects Tasks

The role and tasks of the instructor during the Capstone Project weeks changes quite a bit. Here are some resources to help get you prepared for those weeks:

**In preparation for Capstone Projects, instructors:**
- Create groups
- Schedule the Agile/Scrum Presentation
- Present project requirements
- Present groups
- Facilitate the project planning process

The requirements of the capstone project are established in a Capstone Project Spec document presented before they are assigned groups.


### Requirements

A template of that doc is here:
[ Capstone Projects Specs Template ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TzvKHFWc4VZB0Qa97pgO0RX6jaAuOCvpq77fFtC9ji0/edit)


### Instructor Tasks

During the capstone weeks instructors:

- Participate in and help moderate morning stand-ups
- Conduct code reviews
- Provide additional lessons (where applicable)

The main capstone project days themselves are essentially lab days with few to no lessons. The first day has a bit more structure.

**First Day**

The order sometimes varies, but these are the checkpoints:

- Agile Talk
- Break out into groups
    - Decide on project
    - Determine MVP
    - Create wireframes
    - Create user stories
    - Create repo
    - All group members added to the project repo

**After the First Day** of capstone projects there are a few checkpoints building up to the **Final Client Check In**:

- **End of week one**: First Client Check In/ Deploy
- **Mid week 2**: Mini Client Check in
- **End of week 2**: Final Client Check In

Ideally, the projects are fully deployed *prior* to the Final Client Check In.

**Code Reviews (Reviewing Pull Requests)**

Reviewing pull requests on the capstone projects becomes a one of the main tasks for instructors during this phase of the program. It is an opportunity for instructors to fill in some of the best practice gaps and work in the some real world conceptual and domain knowledge.

Comment up those PRs!

It is expected that you will bring your best practices with you along with your PR standards, some of which may be listed here. But you can start with these:

- Address formatting issues
- Recommend deleting broken/incomplete/commented out code
- Draw attention to opportunities to refactor (DRY up or otherwise clean up implementation)
- Recommend removing logs (`console.log()`/`puts`/`pp`)

**Client Check Ins**

Client check ins are an opportunity for instructors to figure out where the projects are, guide steps forward, and help teams narrow the scope of their projects.

The process sometimes varies but looks something like this:

- Examine completed features
- Examine and update user stories (on Trello) with feedback from first look
- Examine remaining stories
- Refine and/or prioritize remaining stories

**Issues During Capstone Projects**

Capstone projects typically present new challenges for students particularly in regards to project management and working on a bigger team. More often than not, when expectations are clearly set (project requirements/process) the projects run pretty smoothly even with the new development hurdles students face.

Still, conflict may arise but may be mitigated at more ideal times if warning signs are caught early on.

Though not always signs of trouble here are some of the **warning signs** that may indicate issues within a group:

- Silos (if it's causing a persistent bottleneck)
- Lack of pull requests from group/individuals
- No requests for code reviews
- Repeatedly getting in late/missing stand up
- Repeatedly leaving early
- Break down of communication
    - Committing over each others' work
    - No clear understanding of what teammates are working on

## Tech Talks

Students are required to present a Tech Talk. For the most part all the Tech Talks are presented on the same day during the last week of a cohort.

### Leading up to Tech Talks

During PD week, students are encouraged to start thinking about their talks. The week before Tech Talks, a sign up sheet is given to a cohort where students can self select their time and their subject. Depending on the size of the cohort, the talks are split into two rooms.

### Preparation

Students are encouraged to have slides to go with their presentations and to practice. Still, there are things that can be done in preparation for the talks that will make them run a bit smoother.

Tech Talk Room Checklist:

- Projector is working (bulb not dead)
- Sound is working (through Sonos or otherwise)
- HDMI cable

**Note for Remote:**
- Everything will take longer than you expect. It is worth scheduling extra time.
- Remind students to practice sharing their presentations on Zoom ahead of time. Speaker notes are often harder to access on a screen share.


### Feedback

Both admin and instruction staff take part in providing tech talk feedback.

Providing feedback is less about grading student performance than it is about getting students comfortable with giving a tech talk and providing tips on how to improve a talk.

Tech talk feedback is aggregated and delivered to the student during a [one on one](#one-on-one) with an instructor.
