### Staff Meetings

All Learn staff attend these weekly meetings which are typically held on Wednesday during the lunch hour. It is on occasion moved to another day if for example a bulk of staff cannot attend.

But the meeting is essentially a check in with all the departments. It is organized such that each department (Marketing, Career Services, Instruction etc.) provides an update and answers any questions about what's happening in their realm of the organization.

Instructors are responsible for reporting attendance, assessment status, and classroom progress. These updates can be done in Slack prior to the meeting.

During the meeting, instructors give an update on the classroom, request any resources, or bring up any issues that have come about in the classroom. Since it is often challenging to keep track of all classroom items throughout the week and in between meetings, it is valuable to utilize the [ Classroom Admin Trello board ](https://trello.com/b/dQBMlYpI/classroom-admin) and keep it up to date for staff meetings.


### Instructor Meetings

These meetings are also typically held on a weekly basis. This is when instructors usually set up the teaching schedule (document who is going to teach which lessons), review and determine any necessary curriculum changes, delegate tasks related to curriculum changes, and discuss the the progress being made by the class. Discussions can sometimes lead to adjustments being made to the curriculum or the strategies used for teaching in the classroom.

It's worth noting that many of the above items are often done ad hoc throughout the course.

### Slack

Slack is the main channel of communication within LEARN. You will use it to coordinate both with staff and students.

LEARN Staff has a paid Slack account that is separate from the community account.

The dedicated instructor channel is here: [ Teachers Channel ](https://app.slack.com/client/TV83K2TV0/C010CSRCT40)

The general channel is for all staff communication:
- [ General Channel ](https://app.slack.com/client/TV83K2TV0/CV83K3AH0)

There is a channel that connects LEARN with Notch8's Slack account. This can be used for direct messages to anyone on the Notch8 team as well as requesting assistance from the Notch8 developers.
- [ LEARN-Notch8 Channel ](https://app.slack.com/client/TV83K2TV0/C010VGJFPCJ)


The LEARN community account will hold all the cohort channels as well as the *everybody* channel. The *everybody* channel connects all alumni, current students, staff, and community partners.
- [ Everybody Channel ](https://app.slack.com/client/T04B40L2C/C04B40L4U)

You will eventually join other channels as well including various cohort channels and the channels created by students entering capstone projects.


### Trello

Trello is used throughout Learn to track our tasks and objectives.

The classroom and curriculum tasks are tracked here: [ Classroom Admin Trello Board ](https://trello.com/b/dQBMlYpI/classroom-admin)

### Classroom Inventory

Classroom inventory is checked on a weekly basis, ideally before staff meetings when any needs can be brought to the attention of admin staff. The administrative assistance helps facilitate tracking and ordering inventory.

Classroom inventory (dry erase markers, printer ink, etc) is tracked here: [Ordering Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YCa8ulGBugSBD9vNvBCwnvaFcrZMYBq-nZKkrC4txzI/edit#gid=555668496)

If it turns out there is any need for resources, a comment written with `@chelseakaufman` can be added to the [ Inventory ](https://trello.com/c/EKJAXwAa/6-inventory-mondays) card in Trello.

### Station Inventory

Station inventory is checked on a daily basis just to ensure that we are aware if any of our machines or peripherals move.

Station inventory is tracked here: [ Station Inventory ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1361Y_1O6hv-iLjWUgy-mopdFWeo8bd7E980XWjaL1QU/edit#gid=0)

This document just tracks the count of working equipment in each room. If any equipment breaks or becomes defective it is tracked in repairs here: [ Repair Inventory ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EIPpqnUuRsLUr4PhzelK0eXf7FjBDU12Y18kf3kmKuI/edit#gid=0)

Any defective equipment can be written in a comment on the [ Repair ](https://trello.com/c/RQnIlOWZ/5-repair) card in Trello.

Typically, defective computer equipment is assessed by Rob before disposal. Larger equipment broken chairs/desks will be assessed by admin staff and usually handled by Union.

### Troubleshooting Equipment

**Projector Sound**

There are two different sound setups that are possible in the classroom and the set up/troubleshooting process is different for each.

##### Wired Speakers (Logitech)

The Logitech speakers have a standard setup:

- Line out from the projector to the speaker set.
- Power on speaker (rotate knob clockwise until it clicks and amber light shines)
- Adjust volume

Troubleshooting:

- Check that it is receiving power
- Check that it is plugged into **AUDIO OUT** on projector
- Volume is up (depending on the video, this may need to be cranked)

##### Wired Speakers (Sonos)

In order to control the source to the Sonos speaker, make sure you have the **Sonos App** downloaded on your phone.

The set up is a bit different:

- Line out from the projector to the Sonos speaker
- The Sonos speaker is always on. When connected to power the status light near the touch controls will glow white
- Open up the Sonos app on your phone
- Select **Browse** in the app
- Select **Line In**
- Select **Audio Component** and the speaker should connect to it's line in

- Select a specific room to play to:
    - Enter the now playing pop up (right above the lower menu)
    - Select the *square* to the right of the volume slider
    - Select/Deselect the appropriate room

Troubleshooting

- Check that it is receiving power
- Check that **AUDIO OUT** on projector is connected to **Line In** (aux in) on Sonos
- Check that Sonos is playing the **Line In** source
- Check that the appropriate room is selected in *Play to the following*
