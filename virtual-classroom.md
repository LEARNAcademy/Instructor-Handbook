# Virtual Classroom Notes and Protocols
[ Back to Main Handbook ](./README.md)

The virtual classroom should mimic the in-person classroom as much as possible.

### Virtual Tech Talks
Virtual events need more time in between each student than their in-person counterpart. Encourage students to check how they can access their notes prior to the presentation. The presenter view can often look different on the Zoom screen share.

### Virtual Pairing
Pair programming in a virtual classroom requires the use of git and screen sharing. Instructors create a shared repository per week for small projects. Large projects are created in GitHub Classroom. The step by step process for pair programming can be found [ here ](https://github.com/learn-academy-2020-bravo/Syllabus/blob/master/tools_and_resources/remote-pairing.md) in the student syllabus.

### Team Building Activities
Team building in a virtual classroom must be done more intentionally than in an in-person class. Each day after lunch the instructors take turns leading a 15-30 minute team building activity.

There is a [ resource ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ntHroUNYuVL7ENkq3jUBQp5iPQXL_Y5BGwKQsh56eqY/edit) for documenting ideas in the Classroom Drive.


### Instructor Responsibilities and Flow for a Virtual Classroom

#### Before Class
- Slack out next day's schedule
- Pin schedule to cohort slack channel with classroom Zoom link
- Unpin the previous day's schedule
- Post zoom links to any external talks
- Select a [ check in question ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h4VtVJIL5GlhZrsxX6dVQmEM2SL638r87SjqoShqYoU/edit)
- Create a random check in order - keep it available for checkout

#### Starting Class
- Open Zoom classroom at 8:45
- Post checking question and check in order in Slack
- Once the class has joined the meeting, post the check in question and order in Zoom chat, the Zoom chat cannot be seen by anyone joining the meeting after the question was posted so don't post too early

#### Check in
- Each person answers the question, when they "check in" everyone waves
- Instructor goes over the daily schedule and announcements

#### Lecture
- Instructor shares screen with class
- Instructor builds out code example
- Instructor can see "hand raise" icon and should encourage questions
- Is helpful when other instructors can add or clarify points, raise questions, and monitor the chat

#### Challenges
- Create groups for daily challenges, put in "cohort groups" doc
- add students to breakout rooms, look out for students using separate camera/screen zooms, you'll have to add both
- Encourage questions in cohort slack channel
- Instructor drops in on groups to check on progress, answer questions, and check on group dynamics

#### Student Pairing
- Each student can use his/her own environment (text editor/terminal)
- One student begins as the driver
- Create a new project and a GitHub repo in the cohort org
- In turn, each student clones the repo and installs dependencies
- Driver ends his/her turn with a git add/commit/push
- New driver starts with git pull
- TODO: docs for branching / merging

#### Talks
- Additional zoom link, posted in the daily schedule

#### Afternoon Lecture

#### Afternoon Challenges
- If students leave the Zoom room they must be reassign to breakout rooms, keep the "cohort groups" doc handy
