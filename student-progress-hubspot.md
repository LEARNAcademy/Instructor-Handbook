## Instructor Usage of HubSpot

The main things that get tracked are:
- Notes taken for each student during a one-on-one
- Assessment feedback and notes (from a Google Doc)
- Attendance (from a Google Doc)
- Capstone Project Info

- Save! 
- Pro-tip: The save button is strangely unreliable so as you're taking notes during one-on-ones, it might be safer to do it in a Google Document or somewhere where you have it kept safely for backup because HubSpot has a tendency to not save input sometimes.
- Refresh window to ensure the notes are saved.
