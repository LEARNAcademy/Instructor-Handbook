# LEARN Attendance Policy
##### As of August 2019

### Policy Documents

On the first day of class, [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k_S8xsFyOANnzwNUmYeMf-KAuYq5XPY9Vqw6e_Iz7sU/edit#slide=id.p) goes over the details of the requirements and expectations of punctuality and attendance. If these expectations are not met the student risks not being eligible for internship. To acknowledge this requirement, all students are required to sign [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tvjFpQjgvFkzyYbfnFh7kFDHqvMKTEewRgzARqJ467g/edit#heading=h.ig1j3omjc8u6).

### When Issues Arise

**Absences**

After a student has missed more than three days of class, the instruction team will choose a staff member to sit down with the student. The goal of this meeting is to identify issues or problems that are leading to the repeated absences and offer help if appropriate. It should also be pressed upon the student the importance of attending class for the following reasons:
- The student's tech skills can suffer if lectures and presentations are repeatedly missed
- Important announcements or events can be missed
- LEARN is a team environment the entire cohort depends on all student's presence
- LEARN encourages personal growth and responsibility

If the student misses two additional days of class, the next step is a meeting with Chelsea to discuss the possibility of becoming ineligible for internship.

**Tardiness/Leaving Early**

If a student is repeatedly late or leaves class early, the instruction team will choose a staff member to sit down with the student.
