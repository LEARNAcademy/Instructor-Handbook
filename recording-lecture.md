# Recording Lectures/Talks


## When do we record?


### Anytime we are teaching anything to the class we should be recording



*   If students are just randomly asking questions, those do not need to be recorded
*   If the activity is planned ahead of time and includes any planned lesson, those should be recorded
*   Example: Any lectures that are in the syllabus or lesson plans


## Saving recordings


### As soon as the instructor begins, he or she should hit record



*   Zoom channel hosts are the only ones who can record
*   You can request to record if you are not the host
*   Instructors should be the ones recording, not the students
*   Instructors should remind each other to record when beginning an activity


### Recordings should be saved to the cloud



*   Anyone with access can then grab the video and post it to YouTube
*   At the end of each day, the instructor leading the lecture should go into the cloud, download the MP4 file, and add it to the Learn YouTube account
*   Once the video has been added to YouTube, they should delete the video from the Zoom cloud recordings in order to leave enough space in the Zoom cloud for future recordings
