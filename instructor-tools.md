## Instructor Tools
[ Back to Main Handbook ](./README.md#instructor-handbook)

### GitHub

Just about all the course materials live on GitHub. There are repos that exist for the syllabus, class assessments, and projects. Each organization will have their own copies of these materials. Most of the larger student projects and all assessments are administered through GitHub Classroom.

### GitHub Classroom

GitHub Classroom essentially allows us to track student work throughout the course and its use increases student interaction with git and GitHub.

Here assignments are created for a cohort organization and links are generated that, when clicked by student, triggers the generation of a repo for that project within the cohort organization.

[Weekly individual assessments](#reviewing-assessments) are assigned each Friday via GitHub Classroom.

To create a GitHub Classroom assignment with starter code it must be a stand alone repository in the LEARN Academy Organization and then forked into the individual cohort's organization on GitHub - the starter code repository cannot be tied to any other repository.  Add the GitHub Classroom link to accept the assignment to the repo description.  In the README of the starter code for GitHub Classroom assignments include any terminal commands needed to get the project spun up and a link to the relevant Syllabus materials.  A GitHub Classroom assignment can be created without starter code as well.

### GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects can be utilized as a project management board for running questions. Students can add questions to the board for anyone to answer. Students can also edit cards or add "votes" to a question. These questions can also be used to determine the concepts to cover for a review session.

### YouTube

LEARN uses YouTube to capture lessons using Live Events.

Here is a link to the steps to creating a Live Event: [Creating YouTube Live Events](./youtube-live-events.md)

**Note for Remote:** Here is a link to the steps to uploading lectures from Zoom: [Adding Lectures to YouTube](./recording-lecture.md)

### Live Captioning

In order to provide live captions of lectures a web service is used.  [Web Captioner](https://webcaptioner.com/captioner) site will caption the speaking live during the event through the standard microphone.  The web captioner only works with Google Chrome Browsers.  To include captions in the OBS live stream click the 3 dots next to Start Captioning and select New Window. Adjust the new window to fit in the OBS screen by dragging the edges of the new window.  It has already been added to the OBS feed as Captions.  Information on [Terms of Service](https://webcaptioner.com/terms-of-service/) and [Privacy Policy](https://webcaptioner.com/privacy-policy/).

### Google Drive

Google drive contains many of the documents related to non-curriculum related tasks. It contains documents to help you track lesson plans, inventory, first day schedules, and a host of other things.

### HubSpot

HubSpot is LEARN's CRM (Customer Relationship Management) used to track student communication, progress, and interactions from their initial contact with LEARN all the way through job placement. As an instructor, you are responsible for adding notes detailing the one on one meetings that take place three times a during a cohort. Typically, the one on ones occur during Week 3, Week 9, and Week 12 of the cohort.

To access HubSpot you will need to be granted access by the LEARN admin staff.
